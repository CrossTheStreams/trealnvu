# Play Data

These samples are from the ape woodmouse library. The sequences were taken, cleaned, aligned, a tree was build, sequences were translated (poorly, I'll add - see stop codons), and a fake metadata table was built. The stuff you'll want to use (for now)...

* output/metadata.csv
* output/aligned.fasta
* output/ftree.tre


Later, we can play with adding multiple alignments
