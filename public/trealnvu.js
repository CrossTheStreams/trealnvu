//I'm thinking stick functions and library code in here, then call whatever relavant functions,
//prototypes we contruct from a little script in the index.html to load the data in the data dir.
//This has been set up to work so that if you make a request for /data/aligned.fasta, for example,
//then you will get the raw text from that file. So the trick here is to build a) the functions
//that will make those requests, b) the functions that will parse that data and c) the functions
//that will go to town with d3 to make everything link up
